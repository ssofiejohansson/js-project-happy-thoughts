# Happy Thoughts

Happy Thoughts is a messaging app built with React that lets users share short messages with the world. It connects to a shared public API, allowing anyone to post and read happy thoughts in real time. Messages appear in reverse chronological order, with the newest thoughts at the top. Each thought displays the message content and a like count, which can be increased by clicking the heart button.
